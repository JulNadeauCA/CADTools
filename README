CADTOOLS
========

What is it?
-----------
cadtools is an open-source 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing
(CAM) toolkit. Its main component is a parametric, feature-based, solid
modeler which comprises a generic solver for systems of geometrical
constraints. Eventually, we hope the solver will become sufficiently robust
to handle rigid-body simulation over arbitrarily complex mechanical assemblies.

A major advantage cadtools will have over commercial CAD packages, besides
portability, will be extendability and an open, well-documented API.

cadtools requires the Agar toolkit (http://libagar.org/).

cadtools is still in early development phase. Most of critical code being
written for cadtools (such as geometric constraint solving) is actually being
implemented into the Agar-SG library.

Documentation
-------------
This package includes API documentation in the form of manual pages. You
can also read the manual pages online or download the pages in HTML or
printable format from the cadtools website.

Availability
------------
You can download the most recent cadtools version from the cadtools home page
at http://hypertriton.com/catools/.

Portability
-----------
cadtools is portable to all platforms supported by Agar. This includes,
notably, Linux, IRIX, MacOS Classic, MacOS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Windows, and even some game consoles. See: http://libagar.org/portable.html
